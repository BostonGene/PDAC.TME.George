# PDAC Tumor Microenvironment Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for classifying the tumor microenvironment (TME) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) based on functional gene signatures (FGEs).

## Overview
PDAC presents a complex tumor environment, which has historically posed challenges in the development of reliable predictive biomarkers for targeted therapies and immunomodulation. To address this, we've implemented a classification approach based on transcriptomic profiling of the TME.

Developed classification is described in [Paper's DOI link]

## Features
This repository contains:
- Data
-- Meta-Cohort: annotation & calculated FGEs
-- ICGC PACA-CA (test cohort): annotation & expressions
Code presented in "MFP_TME_classificataion.ipynb" include:
- Data Processing: Scripts to preprocess and clean the PDAC datasets.
-- Calculation of FGEs
- Classification: Algorithms to classify TME into four distinct subtypes:
-- Immune enriched (IE)
-- Immune enriched, fibrotic (IE/F)
-- Fibrotic (F)
-- Immune depleted (D)
